# Project: Artificial Life Simulator

# This project is a simulation of a natural environment that contains different types of living organisms; in this case carnivores, herbivores, and plants. The purpose of the simulation is to show how each type of organism interacts with one another. The environment is initialized as a 2D 16x16 array, with random numbers of carnivores, herbivores, and plants placed in random locations. The simulation runs under the following rules:


## - Carnivores and herbivores can move in random directions in every iteration of the simulation. Moving uses energy.

## - If a carnivore encounters a herbivore it will eat the herbivore, and if a herbivore encounters a plant it will eat the plant. Energy is gained when eating.

## - Carnivores and herbivores will reproduce with their respective kind if two members encounter each other and they are of a certain age. Reproduction uses energy.

## - Carnivores and herbivores will die if they run out of energy.

## - Plants grow in random iterations in random locations.

# This simulation runs for 32 iterations. I gained experience using polymorphism while working on this project.

# This project was written using Java.
